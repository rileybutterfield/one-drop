# Riley's One Drop Homework Assignment

## Assignment Instructions

You should budget an hour of coding time. We realize that is a tight constraint but we're trying to be respectful of your time while still allowing you to produce enough code for us to make a fair assessment of your skills. We'd rather review high-quality incomplete work than rushed but complete work.
